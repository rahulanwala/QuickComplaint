                                                  QuickComplaint

This project was a collaborative effort between me, Rahul Anwala (21EC10053), and my friend, Tony Singh (21CE10075).

QuickComplaint is a responsive web application developed using React that is designed to streamline the process of reporting and tracking issues like electricity and Wi-Fi problems in hostel rooms. The system provides a user-friendly platform for students to ensure their living conditions are well-maintained.

User authentication features include login and signup options, allowing new users to register and existing users to log in. After successful signup, users are directed to a confirmation page and the login page. The main dashboard features a simple header and footer for easy navigation and includes a status page where users can track the progress of their complaints. Additionally, guidance and announcements are displayed to inform users about important updates.

Users can submit complaints by entering their room number and selecting an issue from a dropdown menu. If the problem is not listed, they can choose 'Other' and provide a detailed description. Once submitted, the complaint is added to the status page for tracking. Users also have the option to update their profile information and log out through the profile section in the header.

The project uses React.js for the front end, with React hooks managing component states. Designed to be responsive, the application ensures compatibility across devices and simplifies the reporting and resolution process for hostel issues, demonstrating my ability to create practical solutions with modern web technologies.
